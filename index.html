<h1>This is a website that hopefully works!</h1>
<p>
  This is a test website to play with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode">PunyCode</a> subdomains, because the literature that I'm reading isn't exactly clear on how it works or where you can use it. If you can see this, I guess it works!
</p>
  <h2>Eh?</h2>
  <p>
  This website's DNS entry is: <b>https://xn--4o8h.markstrendin.ca</b>, which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode">PunyCode</a> encoding for <b>https://üê∞.markstrendin.ca</b>. Typing either of these in your address bar should get you here.
  </p>
  <p>This method can be used to obscure URLs by using letters from other languages that look identical or similar to english ASCII characters. Or it can be used to include any Unicode character in a domain name, like üê∞.</p>
  <h2>So that's all that's here?</h2>
  <p>Yup. You can see the source code for this entire website here if you'd like to confirm: <a href="https://github.com/MarkStrendin/Test-Punycode-Webpage">https://github.com/MarkStrendin/Test-Punycode-Webpage</a>.</p>
